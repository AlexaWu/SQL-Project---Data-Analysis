### Subquery

- Find the average number of events for each day for each channel. The first table provide the number of events for each day and channel, and then average these values together using a second query

Step 1, group by the day and channel. Then ordering by the number of events (the third column).

```javascript
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
   channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

Step 2, get a table that shows the average number of events a day for each channel.

```javascript
SELECT channel, AVG(events) AS average_events
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
             channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

select channel, count(date_trunc),
	sum(count)/count(date_trunc) as avg
from
(select date_trunc('day', occurred_at), channel, count(*)
from web_events
group by date_trunc, channel
) as sub
group by channel;
```
