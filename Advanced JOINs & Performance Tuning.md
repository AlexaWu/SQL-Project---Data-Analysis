# FULL OUTER JOIN

> FULL JOIN is commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount of overlap between two tables. A common application of this is when joining two tables on a timestamp. 

As an analyst at Parch & Posey you want to see:

- `each account who has a sales rep` and `each sales rep that has an account` (all of the columns in these returned rows will be full)
- but also `each account that does not have a sales rep` and `each sales rep that does not have an account` (some of the columns in these returned rows will be empty)

so, selecting all of the columns in both of the relevant tables, accounts and sales_reps

```javascript
SELECT *
FROM accounts
FULL JOIN sales_reps ON accounts.sales_rep_id = sales_reps.id
```

# Inequality JOINs

> Inequality operators (a.k.a. comparison operators) don't only need to be date times or numbers, they also work on strings

- Write a query that **left joins** the `accounts` table and the `sales_reps` tables on each **sale rep's ID number** and joins it using the **<** comparison operator on **accounts.primary_poc** and **sales_reps.name**. The query results should be a table with three columns: the `account name` (e.g. Johnson Controls), the `primary contact name` (e.g. Cammy Sosnowski), and the `sales representative's name` (e.g. Samuel Racine)

```javascript
SELECT accounts.name as account_name,
       accounts.primary_poc as poc_name,
       sales_reps.name as sales_rep_name
FROM accounts
LEFT JOIN sales_reps
ON accounts.sales_rep_id = sales_reps.id
AND accounts.primary_poc < sales_reps.name
 ```
 
 >What is the relationship between accounts.primary_poc and sales_reps.name?\
 The primary point of contact's full name comes before the sales representative's name alphabetically
 
 # Self JOINs
 
 >One of the most common use cases for self JOINs is in cases where two events occurred, one after another.

[Date/Time Functions and Operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/functions-datetime.html)

- Find those web events that occurred after, but not more than 1 day after, another web event, the result includes a column for the channel variable in both instances of the table 

```javascript
SELECT we1.id AS we_id,
       we1.account_id AS we1_account_id,
       we1.occurred_at AS we1_occurred_at,
       we1.channel AS we1_channel,
       we2.id AS we2_id,
       we2.account_id AS we2_account_id,
       we2.occurred_at AS we2_occurred_at,
       we2.channel AS we2_channel
  FROM web_events we1 
 LEFT JOIN web_events we2
   ON we1.account_id = we2.account_id
  AND we1.occurred_at > we2.occurred_at
  AND we1.occurred_at <= we2.occurred_at + INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY we1.account_id, we2.occurred_at
```

# UNION

> UNION removes duplicate rows.
UNION ALL does not remove duplicate rows.(more often)\
Both tables must have the same number of columns.\
Those columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.\
Column names don't need to be the same to append two tables

For example: When you want to determine all reasons students are late. Currently, each late reason is maintained within tables corresponding to the grade the student is in.

The table with the students' information needs to be appended with the late reasons. It requires no aggregation or filter, but all duplicates need to be removed. So the final use case is the one where the UNION operator makes the most sense.

- Write a query that uses UNION ALL on two instances (and selecting all columns) of the `accounts` table.
```javascript
SELECT *
    FROM accounts

UNION ALL

SELECT *
  FROM accounts
 ```
- Add a WHERE clause to each of the tables that you unioned in the query above, filtering the first table where `name equals Walmart` and filtering the second table where `name equals Disney`
```javascript
SELECT *
    FROM accounts
    WHERE name = 'Walmart'

UNION ALL

SELECT *
  FROM accounts
  WHERE name = 'Disney'
 ```

- Perform the union in first query in a common table expression and name it `double_accounts`. Then do a COUNT the number of times a name appears in the `double_accounts` table
```javascript
WITH double_accounts AS (
    SELECT *
      FROM accounts

    UNION ALL

    SELECT *
      FROM accounts
)

SELECT name,
       COUNT(*) AS name_count
 FROM double_accounts 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
 ```
# Performance Tuning

To make a query run faster is to reduce the number of calculations that need to be performed: 

>Table size\
Joins\
Aggregations

Query runtime is also dependent on some things that you canâ€™t really control related to the database itself:

>Other users running queries concurrently on the database\
Database software and optimization (e.g., Postgres is optimized differently than Redshift)
